%% \begin{abstract}
%% Demonstrating strength and agility on virtual and real humanoids has
%% been an important goal in computer graphics and robotics.
%% However, developing physics-based controllers for various agile motor skills
%% requires a tremendous amount of prior knowledge and manual labor due to
%% complex mechanisms of the motor skills.
%% The focus of the dissertation is to develop a set of computational tools to
%% expedite the design process of physics-based controllers that can execute a
%% variety of agile motor skills on virtual and real humanoids.
%% Instead of designing directly controllers real humanoids, this
%% dissertation takes an approach that develops appropriate theories and models in
%% virtual simulation and systematically transfers the solutions to hardware systems.

%% The algorithms and frameworks in this dissertation span various topics from
%% specific physics-based controllers to general learning frameworks.
%% We first present an online algorithm for controlling falling and landing
%% motions of virtual characters.
%% The proposed algorithm is effective and efficient enough to generate falling
%% motions for a wide range of arbitrary initial conditions in real-time.
%% Next, we present a robust falling strategy for real humanoids that can manage
%% a wide range of perturbations by planning the optimal contact sequences.
%% We then introduce an iterative learning framework to easily design
%% various agile motions, which is inspired by human learning techniques.
%% The proposed framework is followed by novel algorithms to
%% efficiently optimize control parameters for the target tasks, especially when
%% they have many constraints or parameterized goals.
%% Finally, we introduce an iterative approach for exporting simulation-optimized
%% control policies to hardware of robots to reduce the number of hardware
%% experiments, that accompany expensive costs and labors.
